## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files
- **upload.html**: This file will contain the HTML form for uploading the PDF report. It should include a file input field for selecting the PDF to upload and a submit button to initiate the upload process.

### Routes
- **POST /upload**: This route will handle the uploading of the PDF report. It should validate the input to ensure that a PDF file is selected.
- **POST /process**: This route will handle the processing of the uploaded PDF report. It should extract the relevant data from the PDF and generate a Google Sheet with the processed data.
- **GET /data**: This route will serve the processed data in a Google Sheet format. It should allow users to download the sheet as a CSV or Excel file.

### Design Summary
This Flask application design provides the necessary structure to build a web application for uploading and processing PDF reports related to medical insurance claims. The three routes and two HTML files cover the essential functionality for file upload, data processing, and data retrieval.

### Additional Considerations
- Error handling should be implemented to provide appropriate feedback to users in case of any issues during the upload or processing stages.
- Security measures should be considered to protect against malicious file uploads or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- The application can be further customized to meet specific requirements, such as integrating with external services or providing additional features for data analysis or visualization.
